#  MIXXX Dj software dashboard companion.

It is meant to complement my use of MIXXX as a tool for DJ-ing at swing and blues social dance events, as a ways to explore and analyze my library and my sets, and reflect on my choices and posibly give me new ideas to explore.
Eventually It could I would like to turn it into a built in add-on or a fork of MIXXX for social dance Djs. 

This program uses SQlite and Dash to generate a dashboard from a query of "mixxxdb.sqlite", a file that contains the metadata of my MIXXX library and playlists. 
The dashboard relies on my workflow, where I save the sets I played as playlists with a date and a short description of the event
