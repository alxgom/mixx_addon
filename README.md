This project is an ADD-ON to analyze my data from MIXXX Dj software. 

It is meant to complement my use of MIXXX as a tool for DJ-ing at swing and blues social dance events, as a ways to explore and analyze my library and my sets, and reflect on my choices and posibly give me new ideas to explore.

This program uses SQlite and Dash to generate a dashboard from a query of "mixxxdb.sqlite", a file that contains the metadata of my MIXXX library and playlists. 
The dashboard relies on my workflow, where I save the sets I played as playlists with a date and a short description of the event
